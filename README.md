The ear is a listening, surveillance, and Artificial Intelligence project. It is a device that collects human voices, transcribe them into text, and with that information create new texts. The ear is a machine that through an Artificial Intelligence system creates ideas in real time based on what it is listening to. This piece could be defined as an ironic idea of the surveillance system. In a way, it is not a perfect and functional machine, it constantly makes mistakes, degrading the original information from the source, creating erroneous and potentially false information, digital garbage that in a way undermines the expected fantasies of technology and surveillance systems.
